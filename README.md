# 👋 Hello there, 

I'm Rune, a cloud engineer from 🇧🇪 currently working at vBridge.

☁️ Cloud computing is my passion, and I enjoy experimenting with Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, and the latest technology.

🤖 With my eagerness to automate infrastructure and deploy cloud-native apps effortlessly, I'm essentially the R2-D2 you've been searching for.

🚀 In my free time, you can find me enjoying a refreshing beverage. Let's be honest; some of the best solutions are discovered through friendly conversation and drinks.

🔥 If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing technology, don't hesitate to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runededonder/) with me . Together, we can create something truly amazing.
