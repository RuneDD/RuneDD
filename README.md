# 👋 Hello there, 

I'm Rune, a cloud engineer from 🇧🇪 working at [vBridge](https://www.vbridge.eu/).

☁️ Cloud computing is my passion, and I enjoy experimenting with Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, and the latest technology.

🤖 With my eagerness to automate infrastructure and deploy cloud-native apps effortlessly, I'm essentially the R2-D2 you've been searching for.

😎 In my free time, you can find me enjoying a refreshing beverage. Let's be honest; some of the best solutions are discovered through friendly conversation and drinks.

🚀 If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing technology, don't hesitate to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runededonder/) with me or take a look at our [company website](https://www.vbridge.eu/). Together, we can create something truly amazing .
