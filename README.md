# 👋 Hello there

I'm Rune, a Cloud Engineer based in 🇧🇪, currently part of the [vBridge](https://www.vbridge.eu/) team.

☁️ I love experimenting with tech like Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and 🐧. My passion for migrating clients to serverless applications and solutions has empowered them to optimize operations and manage IT budgets effectively.
